Super concise example from the proposal: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3653.html
- [ ] Tweaked wording for contextual conversions
- [x] Clarifying memory allocation: This one is just about making some wording in the standard documents non-ambiguous: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3664.html
- [x] Sized deallocation: See 3.7.4 Dynamic storage duration in http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3778.html; 
An extra method for declaring a delete operator was added. You can declare a global delete operator that takes a `void*` to the memory you want to delete as well as the size of that memory. Useful in low-level use cases, e.g. when working with HW sensors or in embedded contexts (we think).

## Library Features:
- [ ] User-defined literals for standard library types, \<chrono\> and \<string\>
```C++11 added user-defined literals, but didn’t use them in the standard library. Now some very useful and popular ones work:

auto a_string = "hello there"s;   // type std::string
auto a_minute = 60s;              // type std::chrono::duration = 60 seconds
auto a_day    = 24h;              // type std::chrono::duration = 24 hours
Note s means “string” when used on a string literal, and “seconds” when used on an integer literal, without ambiguity.
```
- [ ] Compile-time integer sequences: std::integer_sequence
- [ ] Std::make_unique
- [ ] Shared mutexes and locking: std::shared_timed_mutex
- [ ] Heterogeneous lookup in associative containers
- [ ] Tuple addressing via type: std::get\<T\>()
- [ ] Constexpr for: \<chrono\>, \<complex\>, \<array\>, \<init_list\>, \<utility\>, \<tuple\>
- [ ] Improved std::integral_constant
- [ ] Null forward iterators
- [ ] Std::quoted
- [ ] std::exchange
- [ ] “Fixing constexpr member functions without const”
- [ ] Dual-Range std::equal, std::is_permutation, std::mismatch
